# Predicting Housing Prices with Scikit-Learn

## Libraries used: 
- Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/)
- SHAP (https://shap.readthedocs.io/)

There were many motivations for this project. The primary motivation was to use a machine learning model to make predictions on house prices through Kaggle.
However, I also explored: 
- Outlier detection with `IsolationForests`
- Pipeline creation with `Pipeline`, and transformers
- Regression with `SVR` and `RandomForest`
- Feature Importance with `SHAP`
- Object-oriented programming and custom classes
